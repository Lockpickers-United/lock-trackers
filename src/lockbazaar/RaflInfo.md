## NEW! Rafl Gift Certificates

Starting this year, people donating pots to the **[LPU Charity Raffle](https://lpubelts.com/#/rafl)** have the option of including "Gift Certificates" redeemable with select #lock-bazaar sellers. Below are the guidelines for both pot contributors and, ultimately, winners. (Still being finalized.)

- Not all sellers will accept gift certificates this year.
- The list of those who will is included below and will be promoted on discord.
- A contributor can create a pot including a gift certificate good for the whole list or just an individual seller, in which case direct coordination would be advised.
- The pot winner will be able to browse from the list of participating sellers on the lockbazaar site.
- It is the responsibility of the winner to choose a buyer who ships to their location, etc.
- The pot winner will work directly with the seller on a single purchase using the gift certificate.
- If the items + shipping are less than the gift certificate, the contributor only pays the seller that amount.
- If the items + shipping exceed the gift certificate, the pot winner is responsible for any additional costs.
- Once the winner has finalized an order from the seller, the contributor will pay the seller in the manner the seller normally specifies (e.g. PayPal F&F only).
- Once paid, the seller will ship the items to the pot winner.
