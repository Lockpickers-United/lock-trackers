1. **The lock must be listed on the [LPU Belt Ranking site](https://lpubelts.com/)**
    * Be sure to follow all the LPU evidence rules for each lock.
    * Remember that speed picking, unlike belt ranks, is picker vs picker.
    * Videos will be under greater scrutiny because of this, and it is the advice of the mods that you leave no room for doubt or suspicion in your submission.
   
2. **Locks must be single pin picked (or single disc turned)**
    * No bypassing, raking, bumping, dialing, zipping, exploding, or other non-SPP opening methods will be accepted.
3. **The lock must be shown to be in a locked state and or functioning as intended prior to picking**
    * If keyless, demonstration of the shackle being locked and the core unable to turn followed by a rake or zip of the pins while under no tension will suffice.
    * Certain locking mechanisms will require assembly prior to picking to prove that all security features are engaged.
    * If you have questions regarding assembly requirements, please contact the speed pick mod team.
4. **Locks with additional evidence requirements**
    * The Corbin Russwin Emhart must be assembled on camera before picking, which is above and beyond the LPU belt ranking requirements.
5. **Once the lock has been picked, it must be gutted on camera if able to do so nondestructively**
6. **Video submission requirements**
    * Landscape videos are preferable.
    * YouTube Shorts is not an acceptable video format.
    * Assembly, pick, and gut must be filmed in one continuous take while the lock stays within frame the entire time.
    * ​​Your video should include a clear close-up of the pins or other locking elements from the lock.
    * Video must have the ability to check timestamp or play time to verify submitted pick time.
    * The video must have a link that can be viewable by other pickers (even if only viewable by the link in the speed pick submission). Time stamps for videos longer than 5 minutes is greatly appreciated.
    * The timer starts once the pick/flag/DD tip enters the lock and continues till the lock is open or the lock is reset to its locked state.
    * What if there are multiple attempts?
        1. Demonstrate again resetting the lock in a fully locked state.
        2. If the lock has a key, then it must be used.
        3. Follow all rules for locks like Medeco that need to be raked and Emhart which must be assembled prior to picking **before each attempt**.
    * If no key is available: use tension tool to show the core plug is unable to turn in both directions and then rake or zip the lock without a tension tool in the core plug to show pins are reset.
7. **Additional Submission Details**
    * You need to sign in and create a profile in order to submit a time.
    * The lock you pick is indicated by pasting the LPUbelts URL into the New Entry form.
    * After submitting, your entry will not be displayed to other users until a mod approves it. Please be patient, it may take a day or two for your entry to be reviewed.
    * While not required, we recommend adding your discord or reddit username to your profile in case mods need to contact you about your submission.
